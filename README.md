# react-bg-changer

I created this app using codesandbox which is great website to start making a react app in less then a minute.

To fork this web app on [`codesandbox`](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-background-changer-7pxxnx). 

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/App.js` as this contains most of the page contents . The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
